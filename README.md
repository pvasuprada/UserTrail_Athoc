## TODO:

1. Implement snapping to nearest road using ArcGIS's 'Closest Facility' tool ‚Äî this wasn‚Äôt possible due to no service credits.
2. Arrow Directions
3. Implementing Context to manage map state.
4. Implement a config-driven approach for the map functionalities.

## Description :

Initially two user locations should appear on the map (100ms to get new points).

On click of "Show trail" should show the dotted line. (I have not removed the old user markers for better visualisation).

On click of "Zoom to Users" should zoom to the extent of all users.On click of user markers give Address.

In alluserslocations.js there is a User C code to test the functionality for¬†3 users.

On zooming out to 13 and less, Group icon appears and popup shows user names.
